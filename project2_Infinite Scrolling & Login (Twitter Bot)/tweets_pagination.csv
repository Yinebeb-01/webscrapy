@TwitterSupport,"We had big hopes for Fleets, but now it’s time to say goodbye and take flight with other ideas. Starting August 3, Fleets will no longer be available. More on what we learned and what's coming (1/4)"
@TwitterSupport,"We had planned for Fleets to help people feel comfortable joining the conversation in a low-pressure way, but it turns out Fleets were mainly used by those Tweeting the most. So now we're ready to explore other ways for people to share on Twitter. (2/4)"
@TwitterSupport,We learned a lot from Fleets and we’re excited to focus on newer and better ways to start conversations on Twitter. We’re proud of the work so far and have no plans of slowing down. (3/4)
@TwitterSupport,"Taking big chances helps us make the best product possible for you, but it doesn't always work out like we planned. It’s not always easy to say goodbye to a feature like Fleets, but we’re excited to get back to work on what we’ve got planned next: https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets.html… (4/4)"
@elfhybrid_,Literally all we want is for you guys to mod more and actually kick out the nazis and the people who harass us the SINGULARLY ONLY THING
@sebparkinson,And an edit button but only once you do the above
@ladyofacat,"Please let us have multiple gifs per tweet I’m begging on my knees. It would be such a popular feature, everyone would love it especially me"
@TwitterSupport,"Hi, Anita. We appreciate your suggestion and will send your feedback to the team."
@krysxpp2,"Hi @TwitterSupport i've been following @krysxpp for long time, this user has never done anything to violate twitter rules. It's suspended w/no email notice. Could u please consider&unsuspend it? She appealed the restriction via case no. #0215097024 bt still no response, TIA."
@BackupKy1e,"Hi @TwitterSupport , I filed a DMCA counter-notification over 10 days ago and never got a notice. This means that my account (@Ky1eWRLD) should have been unsuspended. However, it is still locked. Please unlock my account because it is now in good standing. Case # 0203668923"
@fluffykittensox,I’m impressed that you have actually taken note of what didn’t work and also listened to the populace. Thank you for that it’s appreciated.
@TwitterSupport,
@ukkunn666,"@TwitterSupport Hi, my Twitter account @_Tyupi_ got suspended and I've never violated the Twitter rules. Could you please consider and unsuspend it? I appealed the suspension via the Help Center form but obtained no response. Thank you! Case # 0209112621"
@NickTurner13,"How about getting rid of racists, where's that on your list of priorities?"
@jkkcult,"Please @TwitterSupport Can u unblock my acc @jikookculture ? I really didn't violated any Twitter rules, I am having issues to reset my password cause I don't have email registred to it, just phone number, and it doesn't work. Please help me, this acc it's really important to me!"
@PBTyrrell,"I love it, removal is critical in great design. Well done."
@Psychofrreak,Hello my account ( @bpcabello ) got suspended and I've never violated the Twitter rules. Could you please consider and unsuspend it? I appealed the suspension several times via the Help Center form but obtained no response. Case #0197373131

@dahlila,Buh-bye.
@jmitboyism,#TwitterUnmuteJimin Please unmute Jimin’s name it’s been years already
@nbranche,Interesting. I hope @Twitter doesn’t kill off voice tweets before I get to try it…that feature launched before fleets and I never got around to fleeting
user,text
@althel7,احسن، بعضهم كل يوم ينزل كومة تغريدات ويصور تغريداته ويحطها فلييت! باقي يلاحق فيها الناس في الشوارع نشوف تغريداته. وشكله يرسل على قروبات الواتساب روابط تغريداته وفي الحالة على الواتساب
@dumbledong,Hey @twittersupport my business account (580k) was suspended due to false copyright claims @ellebrookeuk . I successfully appealed all claims and was told after 10 business days my account would be reinstated. I still haven’t obtained any response. Please help #0211860185
@TwitterSupport,Thanks for sticking with us. We're experiencing a rise in cases and our team is working quickly to respond as soon as they can.
@Thunder_Owl,Thank You for throwing that out.
@EBOlady,Hope nothing you do deters me from my favorite function: blocking.
@BriEscobarC,"Editar tuits, no es complicado"
@chaoaretasty,Please give me the space back that the fleets took up rather than replace what you show there
@Alone_Rider1212,Plz add reel option like ig and you tube Thank you
@Kathleenhamil15,"Fleets, we hardly knew ye..."
@PeacefulPagoda,"Glad to not have the insta stories or snaps, now we just need an rdit button."
@Icebox551,maybe stop removing shit and actually implement an edit tweet
@NaSa2013NaSa,Thank you for undisturbing enduser Best decision you have ever made
@joelvmills,"I’d like to see recent tweets in time order. When reading Twitter around an activity or event news, sport or whatever I want to see up to date commentary not yesterday’s tweets. The ICYMI function was better than a jumbled chronology."
@nhfabioo,Something is not working on my twitter account! I can't see the most engaged tweets when I click on the TOP section. Instead it shows the most recent ones! Help me!
@FranDerry,Same same!
@Let_Anita,Does that mean everyone will get the Spaces Tab before then? Or how will they know which Spaces are live when not in Fleets?
@mcclure111,"Okay but let us remove the fleets bar, it sounds like you're just going to leave a list of ""spaces"" there and I don't want to see a list of ""spaces"" either"
@timtfj,"Whatever else you do add, please can you ensure that all users can access it? Fleets are inaccessible via the mobile website, to the extent that I thought they were an off-Twitter thing."
@hybridmoments97,Might be a good idea to look into better ways to remove the racists and trolls from your platform. That would help make it a safer place for shy posters.
@shawnwenzel,"A feature I would love to see is a ""tweet sunset"" where tweets older than a year or two are only visible to you or people you follow unless you retweet them again. Would prevent trolls from digging up old tweets like recently happened to @itskerrii"
@Cally246,Can we have a way to be able to see interactions between accounts? Like if you click on someone’s profile you can see if you’ve interacted before?
@TwitterSupport,"Hey Cally. Thanks for the suggestion, we'll share this with our larger team for consideration."
@MibIH,So maybe now you'll give us the Edit button every Twitter user has been crying out for since day one?
@Chicks126,"To make it ""the best product possible"" add an ""EDIT"" icon. And just accept that people are going to use the word ""fuck"" in their tweets."
@SnakeCharmers,You can improve Twitter with an EDIT button. That's number 1.
@kannemaznn,"hello, @TwitterSupport i'm writing to say that my account has been suspended for over a month, it was suspended on 06/02, i've resorted in all possible ways, but i don't get an answer at all, can you do something ? case #0211230447"
@vsnthdev,"If you could support basic markdown like headings, and other text emphasis... It would be awesome Threads on Twitter can be much more expressive."
@CerebralPalsite,"How about putting tweets in chronological order and stopping promoted tweets taking up more of my timeline then people I actually want to follow? Oh, I forgot. It’s whatever makes the most money first before what actual users want. Moving on."
@mikequinn_,Open up your API to third party clients like @tweetbot and you’ll get more adaption.
@billeh,“taking big chances” lol you added a feature literally every other social network has three years late. pull your head out
@iamonthenet1,What the hell is Fleets
@TheyLove_Chuck,Why y’all need 4 tweets to explain the shit. Just get rid of it
@redmeister81,Blue ticks for all. Sorted
@SweetyGogoi6,Why my this tweet is unavailable it's not any hate or other words i have used requesting you to please ger my tweet available and the reason why unavailable i have not used any bad word or tweeted any hate speech
@lalita_xsiempr,"Hello, please reactivate my account. is @yacque_espos I was suspended for copyright by mistake"
@TampaWoman1965,Can you provide a system for vaccine and political disinformation?
@kgradyback2life,Edit. Option. One that tracks original tweet so their are always receipts. Please and thank you!
@Ouma_Ogutu,I never found them useful or even meaningful. Thank you for taking them away.
@_garud_a,Give us back Moments for smartphones users.
@RaeCorson,Farewell fleeting feature
@3badista,Thank god
@MichaelAhimsa42,Name something after an enema; get flushed.
@Incalculable888,Twitter for close friends seems like it will be promising
@SeanRileyOnline,Bring back animated GIF profile avi’s.
@Nijigakulove,Any update on suspension appeals?
@JamesLMartini,Thanks.
@DogGeneticsLLC,Letting people format text on here has always led to screen reader inaccessibility
@ErikaWang2ndAct,#LoveTwitter
@clnr_lndr,We use them everyday!
@eslegendario,Why not also close the useless Spaces?
@JohannYsbeer13,Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button Edit button
@NIJackal,Who cares!
@stevebristoluk,Got any jobs going ?
@auondrilysuran,Good riddance
@all4kame,I want an EDIT button is that too much to ask????
@RayArnold_VVA,Ok
@robspodcastmug,Now would be a good time for that edit button
@Lindas_Here,"Here’s a novel idea…..an EDIT button! Even one that only gives you a minute or two to edit your tweet! I know it’s possible, because I had a forum with that feature before. Get with the program twitter!"
@eroipu_yakai,"Hi @TwitterSupport , my account @kusokyomu and @Web26735457 got suspended and it never violated the Twitter rules. I appealed the suspension via the Help Center but obtained no response. It's been a month. Could you please consider and unsuspend it? Case number is #0217540559 Thx."
@elementrus,Explicitly copying a feature from multiple other platforms isn't taking a risk. Why pat yourself on the back for plagiarism?
@michellegraz,Here’s an idea - give us an edit button
@ohayoo2018,"Hey I've been using Twitter since 2008. It's ok.Sometimes things don't go well. You know what, we need edit function. I prefer simpler Twitter as it was a decade ago. It'd be much better for us users to fully control our TL. Don't mess it around. Let's make a better Twitterland!"
@kasparknusper,"Thank you for removing Fleets. That was something no one had asked for. And all reasons for Fleets you mentioned, are nothing what a usual tweet could do too anyway, beside beeing self destroyed, which, again, Noone had asked for."
@JR_Bee101,I would very much like to stop seeing peoples likes in my feed.
@reinierxs,Hello @Twitter & @TwitterSupport my fan account ( @lessaxcrf ) got suspended and they never violated the Twitter rules. Could you please consider and unsuspend it? i appealed the suspension via the Help Center form but still suspended. The case number is #0219969298. Thanks
@PurpleT100,"Please put the timeline back to how it was before fleets, and don't fill it with Spaces instead. I've chosen to not use apps that are like your Spaces, so I don't want them on Twitter. Put then where those who use them have access, but out of the way of those who don't."
@PurpleT100,"The blog me tions ""full screen vertical ads"". Please don't. We accept you need ads, but the more they annoy us, like in full screen, the less likely many of us will use the app. Subtlety, rather than IN YA FACE, works far better."
@RobRobbEdwards,Twitter have restricted my account for over 12 months now and I can't get a response You say you are here to help but you do nothing
@Seabulll,"Dear @ilyabr0wn I read your article about fleets. I realize that it's not given much importance, other networks remind you all the time that the person posted a status, here I never remember that it exists... That's missing! Fleet serves to show what worries me a lot right now."
@MrlgPerez,How about you bring back fleets. Don't refresh for us. How about a edit feature? That would be great.
@KingEric1980,"How about having an option to just read tweets of those we follow in chronological order?!throw in the odd promoted tweet if you wish, but @Twitter @Facebook @instagram all with their schizophrenic timelines Would even be happy to pay a £ or two for each to have this option"
